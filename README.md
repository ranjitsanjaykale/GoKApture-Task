# GoKApture-Task
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a dynamic, editable grid using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The grid consists of 1000 cells, each of which can be edited by the user. Key features include:

Grid Rendering: Efficient rendering of 1000 cells in a grid layout. Cell Editing: Each cell is individually editable, with changes stored in memory. Undo/Redo: Simple undo and redo functionality to revert changes. Search: Real-time search to filter grid cells based on user input. This project is ideal for learning about basic state management, DOM manipulation, and event handling in vanilla JavaScript.
